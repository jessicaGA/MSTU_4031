##Final Project

__December 16th__

Each student will prepare a presentation with five slides:

1) Cover slide with project name, team members, and date
2) Project overview: What does the program do?
3) Screen shot of program in operation
4) What you struggled with
5) Final slide - Your choice

Your peers will review your code.

---

##Final Project

__December 9th__

Code Reviews. You will review a classmates code and provide suggestion on how they can improve the code.

#The Pillars of OOP

##Pillars of OOP

__Inheritance__, __encapsulation__ and __polymorphism__ are referred to as the ‘three pillars of object-oriented programming’ - (Liang, 2008).

---


##INHERITANCE

Inheritance is when a subclass inherits accessible variables and methods from its superclass

---


##INHERITANCE

Inheritance is __super__

*	super() invokes the constructor with no arguments from the superclass

*	super(arguments) invokes the superclass constructor that matches the arguments

---


##ENCAPSULATION

Encapsulation is when the details of implementation are hidden
Encapsulation is done by creating objects.

---


##POLYMORPHSIM

Polymorphism, which literally means “many forms,” is the ability of an object variable to take different forms.

---


##POLYMORPHSIM

Lets see an Example:

---


##POLYMORPHSIM

We create a reference variable 'o' that refers to class 's'

---




##POLYMORPHSIM

Class 's' has a subclass 't'.  That is, 't' extends 's'


---


##POLYMORPHSIM

Since 't' extends 's, we have an implied connection to the reference variable 'o'

---


##POLYMORPHSIM

Both 's' and 't' have a method 'move()'

---




##POLYMORPHSIM

Therefore, depending on the object to which the reference variable is referring, we would say that 'o' is polymorphic and can belong to either 's' or 't'

---


##POLYMORPHSIM

Allows us to overload and override.

---

##MORE AWESOMENESS

*	It's also awesome because:

---


##ABSTRACTION

Abstract Classes

*	Abstract classes are a form of a superclass that is so abstract it cannot have any specific instances.

*	Abstract classes cannot be created using the new operator.

*	Constructors within an abstract class are declared as protected 

*	A subclass can be abstract even if its superclass is concrete


---

##ABSTRACTION

Abstract Methods

*	Denoted using the abstract keyword modifier in the method header.

*	Abstract methods are methods from a superclass that are, in one way of thinking, context-dependent upon the subclasses in which they are implemented.

##INTERFACES

*	Interfaces can be used in the same way as an abstract class, but declaring an interface is different from declaring an abstract class

*	There are no constructors in an Interface

*	All variables in an Interface must be public static final

*	All methods in an Interface must be public abstract instance methods
