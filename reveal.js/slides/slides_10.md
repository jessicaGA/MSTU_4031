##Final Project

__December 16th__

Each student will prepare a presentation with five slides:

1.	Cover slide with project name, team members, and date
2.	Project overview: What does the program do?
3.	Screen shot of program in operation
4.	What you struggled with
5.	Final slide - Your choice

Your peers will review your code.

---

##Final Project

__December 9th__: Code Reviews

You will review a classmate's code and provide suggestion on how they can improve.

#The Pillars of OOP

##Pillars of OOP

__Inheritance__, __encapsulation__ and __polymorphism__ are referred to as the 'three pillars of object-oriented programming'

<aside class="notes">
from Liang 2008
</aside>

---


##INHERITANCE

Inheritance is when a subclass inherits accessible variables and methods from its superclass

---


##INHERITANCE

Inheritance is __super__

*	super() invokes the constructor with no arguments from the superclass

*	super(arguments) invokes the superclass constructor that matches the arguments

---


##ENCAPSULATION

Encapsulation is when the details of implementation are hidden
Encapsulation is done by creating objects.

---


##POLYMORPHISM

Polymorphism, which literally means "many forms"," is the ability of an object variable to take different forms.

---


##POLYMORPHISM

Lets see an Example:

---


##POLYMORPHISM

We create a reference variable 'o' that refers to class 's'

---




##POLYMORPHISM

Class 's' has a subclass 't'.  

That is, 't' extends 's'


---


##POLYMORPHISM

Since 't' extends 's', we have an implied connection to the reference variable 'o'

---


##POLYMORPHISM

Both 's' and 't' have a method 'move()'

---




##POLYMORPHISM

Therefore, depending on the object to which the reference variable is referring, we would say that 'o' is polymorphic and can belong to either 's' or 't'

---


##POLYMORPHISM

Allows us to overload and override.

---

##MORE AWESOMENESS

*	It's also awesome because:

---


##ABSTRACTION

__Abstract Classes__

*	Abstract classes are a form of a superclass that is so abstract it cannot have any specific instances.

*	Abstract classes cannot be created using the new operator.

*	Constructors within an abstract class are declared as protected 

*	A subclass can be abstract even if its superclass is concrete


---

##ABSTRACTION

__Abstract Methods__

*	Denoted using the abstract keyword modifier in the method header.

*	Abstract methods are methods from a superclass that are, in one way of thinking, context-dependent upon the subclasses in which they are implemented.

---


##ABSTRACTION

####ACTION LISTENERS

--



##INTERFACES

*	Interfaces can be used in the same way as an abstract class, but declaring an interface is different from declaring an abstract class

*	There are no constructors in an Interface

*	All variables in an Interface must be public static final

*	All methods in an Interface must be public abstract instance methods
