##Instructor

__Jessica T-Skeete__ jt2573@tc.columbia.edu
__Office Hours:__ Mondays 4:00 - 5:30 or by appointment.


---

##Teaching Assistant

__Kenneth Graves__ keg2132@tc.columbia.edu

__Office Hours__ Tuesdays 5:00 - 7:20

##The Course

*	Class starts at 5:30 pm on __Mondays__*	Recitation runs __Tuesdays__ from 7:30 to 8:30 with Kenny.
*	[Syllabus](../../README.md)

<aside class="notes">

I will take attendance in both classes. Attending on Tuesdays will not count towards you final grade, however as the labs get more difficult I will consider that you went to the lab even if the program is not complete.

##The Course Objectives*	Read code and write Java applications.
*	Understand the basics of programming (language agnostic)
*	Rapid prototype your ideas for: 
	*	Better communication 
	*	Testing and research.

##How To Succeed

###You MUST __code__ to learn to __code__!<aside class="notes"> 
Each class we will have from one to eight In-Class Labs (ICLs).  Each ICL is meant to either introduce a new concept or reinforce a previous concept. ICLs provide a practical, hands-on component for exploring and examining computer science topics.

##What is a Program

"A __program__ is a set of instructions that you write to tell a computer what to do" ~ Farrell (2008)
---

##What is Programming__Programming__ is the task of writing instructions in a language that the computer can understand.

##Becoming A Programmer

It's about changing how you think. 

<aside class="notes"> 
It isn't about the programming language. It is about changing how you think.

##Pseudo Code

Pseudocode is the process of writing a program without using the syntax of a programming language.

<aside class="notes"> 
We will talk about algorithms later.

Pseudocode is a mixture of natural language and high-level programming constructs. For example,If the door is closed and I want to exit the room, then open the doorThis semester we will learn what these keywords and structures are and how they are used to create a programâ€¦

<aside class="notes"> 
image from Mit

Scratch is a programming language that makes it easy to create interactive stories, animations, games, music, and art. Scratch is designed to help young people (ages 8 and up) develop 21st century learning skills. As they create Scratch projects, young people learn important mathematical and computational ideas, while also gaining a deeper understanding of the process of design.

##Recap

*	Programming is about giving a set of instructions to the computer. 

*	There are many programming languages but the basic principles are always the same.

*	You must think through the entire application one piece at a time.

---

## Lab Assignment


Go to the [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/explore/?date=ever) website

*	Explore projects
*	Choose a project
*	Review the blocks of code. 
*	Change its behavior.
